		<h2 class="center">WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE LIVING?</h2> 
		<p>
			Sustainable living is fundamentally the application of sustainability to lifestyle choices and decisions. One conception of sustainable living expresses what it means in triple-bottom-line terms as meeting present ecological, societal, and economical needs without compromising these factors for future generations.[6][7] Another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected social domains: economics, ecology, politics, and culture. In the first conception, sustainable living can be described as living within the innate carrying capacities defined by these factors. In the second or Circles of Sustainability conception, sustainable living can be described as negotiating the relationships of needs within limits across all the interconnected domains of social life, including consequences for future human generations and non-human species.[8]
			Sustainable design and sustainable development are critical factors to sustainable living. Sustainable design encompasses the development of appropriate technology, which is a staple of sustainable living practices.[9] Sustainable development in turn is the use of these technologies in infrastructure. Sustainable architecture and agriculture are the most common examples of this practice.[10]
			Lester R. Brown, a prominent environmentalist and founder of the Worldwatch Institute and Earth Policy Institute, describes sustainable living in the twenty-first century as "shifting to a renewable energy-based, reuse/recycle economy with a diversified transport system."[11] Anitra Nelson notes that the Degrowth movement has "pointed to ‘growth’ and ‘growth economies’ as the source of inequities and unsustainabilities" with the result that advocates call for "a radical reduction in production and consumption, greater citizen participation in politics, and more diversity, especially within ecological systems and landscapes, along with a flourishing of creativity, care, and commoning — using renewable energy and materials.[12] Derrick Jensen ("the poet-philosopher of the ecological movement"), a celebrated American author, radical environmentalist and prominent critic of mainstream environmentalism argues that "industrial civilization is not and can never be sustainable". From this statement, the natural conclusion is that sustainable living is at odds with industrialization. Thus, practitioners of the philosophy potentially face the challenge of living in an industrial society and adapting alternative norms, technologies, or practices.

		<h2 class="center">SUSTAINABLE LIVING VS ZERO WASTE---WHATS THE DIFFRENCE</h2>
		<p>
			Sustainable living and the zero-waste movement have similar goals and many similar lifestyle patterns but are a little bit different. Those trying to live sustainably aim to lower their overall environmental impact in a variety of ways, while the primary focus of those living zero-waste is typically to reduce the amount of trash they produce, namely single-use plastic. 

			For example, someone whose primary goal is to live zero waste and produce zero trash may be comfortable eating meat that was purchased without any plastic. But someone aiming to live a well-rounded, sustainable lifestyle may consider the bigger picture (aka the massive environmental impact and ethical concerns of animal agriculture) and opt for a plant-based meal instead, even if it is packaged in plastic.

			Many proponents of the zero-waste lifestyle have taken to calling it the low-impact movement instead, to help shift the focus beyond trash and plastic, and toward lowering one’s overall impact. All that being said, the terms zero-waste lifestyle, low-impact lifestyle, and sustainable lifestyle are often used interchangeably, since they have the same fundamental goal: to lower one’s environmental impact.

			sustainable living guide
			caused by the negative 

			Research all the materials that are possible to be recycled
			Look for and buy more products that can be recycled
			Avoid buying and using non-recyclable products, such as plastic bottles and plastic shopping bags
			Give clothes away or have them repaired instead of throwing them away
			Recycle all materials and recyclable items, such as lithium batteries and ink cartridges, in the correct recycling bins
			Recycle electronic devices and appliances where possible, or donate them if they are still working
			6. Avoid Unethical Businesses
			Big companies and corporations mass produce products on an accelerated scale, often without much care for the negative effects it causes to the environment. 
			How you can try veganism:
			Adopt a more plant-based diet
			Switch meat products for vegan alternatives
			Switch all dairy products for vegan alternatives
			Avoid buying clothes made from animals, such as all leather products
			Avoid buying products made using animals
			Avoid buying products that have been tested on plants.

						With processed plant-based foods, such as vegan burger patties or chicken-like nuggets, becoming more available, there is also concern that plant-based diets incorporating these foods may become less healthy.[21]
						In practice lacto-ovo vegetarians or vegans seem to have a higher overall diet quality compared with nonvegetarians. The reason for this is the closer adherence to health organisation recommendations on consumption of fruits, whole grains, seafood and plant protein and sodium. The higher diet quality in vegetarians and vegans may explain some of the positive health outcomes compared with nonvegetarians.[22]

		<h2 class="center">IMPACT OF SUSTAINABLE LIVING?</h2>
		<p>
			In an era where environmental consciousness is more vital than ever, sustainable living holds significant weight.
			Our everyday choices, from the food we consume to the mode of transport we use, collectively leave an imprint on our planet. Sustainable living is a practical solution to minimize these environmental impacts and contribute to a healthier, more balanced ecosystem.
			It’s not just about safeguarding nature; it also involves a thoughtful approach to our resources and a respectful understanding of our interconnectedness with the world around us.
			By embracing sustainable practices, we contribute to the well-being of our environment and future generations, fostering a legacy of stewardship and mindful consumption.
			As we delve deeper into this topic, we’ll explore the profound impact of sustainable living and its transformative potential to reshape our world for the better.
		</p>

		<p>
			By 2050, the world’s population may reach a whopping 10 billion and with more people comes more demand for – food, fashion, travel, housing and related aspirations. An increasing number of people are unable to meet basic needs while two to three billion new urban consumers and youth will receive the majority of their information from social media. In a world stretched thin for resources and under the threat of global biodiversity loss and climate change, our lifestyles decisions are putting the planet at risk. We need targeted action.
		Sustainable living means understanding how our lifestyle choices impact the world around us and finding ways for everyone to live better and lighter. Applying a ‘people lens’ to sustainability is new, timely and opportunities are great. Sustainable living and lifestyles for the first time appear in the Sustainable Development Goals (4 Education and 12.8 Responsible Consumption). UN Environment Programme is at the forefront of looking into what sustainable lifestyles are and how decision-making can be better harnessed for sustainability. How can governments and business better support and measure change?</p>

				<h3>grow food</h3>
				<p>
					You are what you eat. That is why, if you plan on staying healthy, then you have to eat healthily. The concept of “Go, Grow, Glow foods” was introduced to most adults during their younger years in school and has served as a guide for children to eat healthily. However, as an adult, you grew older and schedules became more hectic, causing you to slowly drift away from what you were taught in school about food. To achieve and maintain good nutrition, you need to reintroduce yourself to the basics that are go grow glow foods.


				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Reduce Waste</h3>
				<p>
					Household waste and recycling services are improving to recover more from your recycling. New glass only recycling services are part of these improvements. You can help by putting your recycling in the bin loose and not in bags.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>insulate houses</h3>
				<p>
					Insulation is a material that slows or prevents the flow of heat and
					insulation is a key part of any passive designed home, helping to keep heat inside the home in winter and outside the home in summer.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>public transport</h3>
				<p>
					The performance of any insulation product – how well it resists heat flow – is know as its R value. The higher the R value, the higher the level of insulation.
